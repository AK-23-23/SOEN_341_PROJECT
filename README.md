## Description and core features

The purpose of this project is to create a communication platform designed for interaction through text channels and direct messaging. Users will be able to create an account to communicate with another user or join channels to message multiple users at a time. Admin accounts can also be created to manage channels, messages, and users.


### High-level user stories for the 3 core features:

* STORY 1:
  
   Users can join predefined text channels, such as sports, movies, and new technologies, to communicate with other users on relevant topics. Messages sent within a channel are visible to all members of that channel.

* STORY 2:
  
   Users can send and receive messages from other users to have one-on-one conversations in a private chat

* STORY 3:
  
   Admins can create and delete channels, as well as moderate messages by deleting inappropriate ones. Members can send and view messages in channels and private messages but do not have the admins' privileges.
